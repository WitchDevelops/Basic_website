<h1>Hi, I'm Domi!</h1>

<p> This page was made during the HTML 101 course on <a href="https://zenva.com/" title="This course is free">Zenva.</a></p>
<br/>
<p>(please scroll below the hackerman, I don't know how to resize images yet or make the website adaptive. But some rudimentary CSS is here.)</p>

<h2>Some stuff that I like:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>cats</li>
  <li>playing games</li>
  <li>reading</li>
  <li>knitting</li>
  <li>learning new stuff</li>
  <li>(and girls)</li>
</ul>

<h2>My long term memory is shocking.</h2>
<p>I can remember WHEN I learned about a thing. So it's either great memory, or early signs of dementia... Anyhow, I remember the HTML basics we learned back at:</p>
<ol>
  <li>middle school (called "gimnazjum")</li>
  <li>high school</li>
</ol>

<p>The content was more or less the same, with the minor difference that in high school we had to create a website as a capstone project. It looked as awful as this shit.</p>
<br/>

<p>Codecademy has some great free resources, too. Find them <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css" title = "Some stuff is free, some is paid"> here</a></p>
<p>If you got bored with this already, go <a href="NewPage.html">here.<a/></p>
